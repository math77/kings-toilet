## First, bat-signal!

I'm looking for a sponsorship of 3 ETH so that I can buy a new laptop/setup (the current one is very old and limits me a bit) and also go full-time on this project and on crypto in general.


## What's it?

An onchain game that will be deployed on the Base network. Get people to register as duelists and challenge each other to meet the contests set by the kingdom, create good art, please the king and win prizes.

Every week a different new king is defined by the previous week's king as his successor or comes to reign, taking the throne for himself.

Let the plebs of the kingdom bet on the duels, collect the art-submissions produced during the duels and throw tomatoes at the duelists they hate.

Take in mind the kingdom note below:

***In a realm of yore, where shadows danced on cobblestone,
There reigned a king, stout and wide, whose whims were widely known.
A connoisseur of art and jests, in memes he sought delight,
Yet oft his mirth could swiftly wane, veering towards cruel might.

Upon a throne bizarrely shaped, a toilet grand and high,
He sat, a ruler of caprice, beneath the azure sky.
A fickle heart, with passions vast, demanded ceaseless cheer,
Or wrath would swell, a tempest fierce, none dared to draw too near.

Thus, knights and jesters, artisans, sought ever to appease,
In quests and feats, they toiled hard, their prowess put to ease.
Through valleys deep and mountains tall, they sought to bring him glee,
For in their toil, they knew full well, the heart of kings was free...***
