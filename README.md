## What's it?

An onchain game that will be deployed on the Base network. Get people to register as duelists and challenge each other to meet the contests set by the kingdom, create good art, please the king and win prizes.

Every week a different new king is defined by the previous week's king as his successor or comes to reign, taking the throne for himself.

Let the plebs of the kingdom bet on the duels, collect the art-submissions produced during the duels like Open Editions (using zora rewards protocol to return ETH to duelists) and throw tomatoes at the duelists they hate.

Some mechanics that I'm excited about in this game:

- Every week there is a different king who comes to the kingdom through succession or by taking the throne
- The king decides who wins the duel between two duelists, which opens the door to the question: is the king fair or corrupt?
- The artwork produced by the winning duelist is transformed into an open edition and is available for 24 hours to mint for "free" by paying the duelist through the zora protocol rewards retroactive fee.
- The king, upon reaching the throne, sets NFTs that will be given as prizes to the duelists who win duels and the winner of the week.
- The " plebs " can bet ETH on which duelist they think will win the duel


## Take in mind the kingdom note below:

***In a realm of yore, where shadows danced on cobblestone,
There reigned a king, stout and wide, whose whims were widely known.
A connoisseur of art and jests, in memes he sought delight,
Yet oft his mirth could swiftly wane, veering towards cruel might.***

***Upon a throne bizarrely shaped, a toilet grand and high,
He sat, a ruler of caprice, beneath the azure sky.
A fickle heart, with passions vast, demanded ceaseless cheer,
Or wrath would swell, a tempest fierce, none dared to draw too near.***

***Thus, knights and jesters, artisans, sought ever to appease,
In quests and feats, they toiled hard, their prowess put to ease.
Through valleys deep and mountains tall, they sought to bring him glee,
For in their toil, they knew full well, the heart of kings was free...***
